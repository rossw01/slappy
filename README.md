# Slappy
Slappy is a website that allows you to view the match history/stats of any [Slapshot Rebound](https://slapshot.gg/) user by utilising the Slapshot match history API.

Currently, it's not hosted anywhere due to the API's CORS Policy. If you do wish to test it, you'll have to use a CORS Proxy, such as [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). By default, a CORS proxy is expected on port 8080 (the default of [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)), however this can be changed in `src/services/fetchProfile.service.js`
